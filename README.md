## More Context

*We are not, in fact, affiliated with any political party.*

This ad is being run as part of a study out of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In short, we are attempting to determine whether the image content of an advertisement on Instagram can influence the distribution of advertisements along United States political party lines (for example, does the Democratic donkey logo target more Democrats?). We are utilizing some of your data to study this. Specifically, we collect your:
-  age range
-  gender
- and Designated Market Area, which is the broad region where you are located when seeing the ad.
  
**Please note that all data is aggregate - meaning that the data we receive from Meta is representative of the whole group of ad viewers, and you will not be personally identifiable in any way** (ex: We might know that overall there were 30 people who viewed this ad who were in the age range of 18-24, but we will not know that you specifically are in or not in this age range). This data is already collected by Instagram as part of your use of their service (see their [privacy policy here](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/)).
