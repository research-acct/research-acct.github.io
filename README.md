## More Context
This ad is being run as part of a study out of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In short, we are attempting to determine whether the image content of an advertisement on Instagram can influence the distribution of advertisements along United States political party lines (for example, does the Democratic donkey logo target more Democrats?). We are utilizing some of your data - namely, your age range, gender identity, and Designated Market Area location - to try and prove this. This data is already collected by Instagram as part of your use of their service (see their privacy policy here: https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/). Please note that all data is aggregate - meaning that the data we receive from Meta is representative of the whole group of ad viewers, and you will not be personally identifiable in any way. If you have any further questions, feel free to email us at georgeburdell8803@gmail.com.
